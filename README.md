# Initial State SmartThings SmartApp

This repository is a host of the Initial State Event Sender - a SmartThings SmartApp intended to make easy the process of sending events that ocur on a SmartThings network to Initial State for visualization.

The actual SmartApp code is inside the official [SmartThings Public](https://github.com/SmartThingsCommunity/SmartThingsPublic/blob/master/smartapps/initialstate-events/initial-state-event-streamer.src/initial-state-event-streamer.groovy) github repo. However, because of the way SmartThings does app aproval and deployment as well as the requirement for commit squashing, I wanted to keep the code in a separate repo as well to keep the git history. This way, any change in the official github repo can just be a copy and paste commit.

Additionally, you'll find un-official or do-it-yourself SmartApps in this repo like the unbuffered Initial State Event Sender (which is based on the original design of this app and is by its very nature much less complex and therefor less fragile in the SmartThings ecosystem).
